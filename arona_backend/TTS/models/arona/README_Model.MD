# README_Model
In this folder, you MUST place MB-iSTFT-VITS model here that ends with .pth
It is really easy to find one on HugginFace, since most of those TTS Models are for MB-iSTFT-VITS.
### I used one from here:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/project-ori/AronaTTS/tree/main/pretrained_model
You also need to place .json at configs.
Remember, this project is for personal use, so using this will require some modification to the code. Most of them will be the same, but if you have different model names or different .json file names, you need to change few lines so it matches you're files
